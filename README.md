## 🚀 About The Project

This website was designed as a surprise gift with interactive elements, animations, and personalized messages.  
It showcases dynamic front-end functionality using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main idea was to create something meaningful while practicing real-world web development concepts.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Custom animations and visual effects  
- 🎵 Background music integration  
- 💬 Personalized messages  
- 🎮 Interactive buttons and events  
- 🤖 Playful logic with JavaScript DOM manipulation  

### Special Feature

One of the key interactive elements is the **"Do you love me?"** prompt:

- If the user clicks **“No”**, the button moves randomly around the screen
- The button keeps escaping until the user finally clicks **“Yes”**
- Implemented using JavaScript event listeners and dynamic positioning

This feature demonstrates creative problem-solving and DOM interaction.
